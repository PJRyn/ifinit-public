<h2>About if{init}</h2>
<p>Hello there! This is a small post just describing what I am doing (and plan to do!) with this website. So let me start off by introducing myself to you, I am Perry a computer science student at Deakin University. I have also completed a data analysis 'boot camp' from Monash University. Both of these courses have given me lots of technical skills and knowledge. However, these courses by themselves don't always teach every skill I am currently interested in learning and improving upon. So I often take on lots of personal projects to learn and expand my skill set. But one problem I have is that once I finish something I don't really reflect or post it somewhere that is easy to share. That's why I made this website as a way to write down projects that might have otherwise been forgotten about (and left in complete) or left to collect dust on my hard drive. This place helps to give me somewhere to write out and reflect on what I am currently working on. That way I can have a bit more reason to see all of my projects through as well as have a way to actually share them with other people. So thanks for stopping by and please check out some of my posts while you are here! If you want to reach out to me in any way please check out my <a href=" https://www.linkedin.com/in/peregrinryan/">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p>Again thanks for stopping by.</p>
