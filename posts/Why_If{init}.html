<h1>Why If{init} - the reasons to blog</h1>
<p>Making a blog in 2024 is a bit of an odd decision. Most of the web has long since left blogging as a medium. With the rise of social media sites like, Twitter, Reddit and YouTube, there is a bit less reason to make a blog. They all provide great ways to share content. However, I wanted to create a bit of a personal space to share and keep track of the projects I am working on. A site where you don't need to worry about ads, views, likes and the rest of the baggage that social media can give to a potential poster. So for my first post I wanted to set out why I made this blog, and what I intend on doing with it. Partially as a test post for debugging but also as something I can check back on to remind myself of why I am undertaking this long term project.</p>
<p>To start off I wanted to discuss how I began to get interested in blogging. I think it came down to three things. The first and the way I interacted with blogs the most was through the table top community. A lot of people have shared projects, ideas and stories around table top gaming. I often followed Reddit posts linking to folks blogs or found reviews for game rules / modules that folks had uploaded. It was a fantastic niche way for people to share their passions to others who were interested. The second was the use of personal websites / blogs by people in the tech industry. It was really cool to see how professionals had created a digital business card, showing off skills or experience in an accessible way. The third and the one that was a bit of a kick in the rear to make my own blog was when my friend had made <a href="https://discursiveloop.com/">Discursive loop</a>, a personal blog where they share things that have interested them. It was cool to see how someone I knew had made something shared online. It made me realise creating a blog without the use of Square space or WordPress and publish it online wasn't something impossible. So I had decided to go about making my own.</p>
<h2>Why make a blog though?</h2>
<p>I had a few reasons to make a blog for myself. The one that initially got me wrapped up into this was a need for me to start a project that I had no clue where to start. I haven't till this point had much of a run in with any web-dev. Well at least web-dev that wasn't hosted on Github pages. My boot camp had given me some experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and even some hosting locally with Flask. But that all was in a bit more of a structured environment and one that didn't need me to figure out a more permanent and public way to host my website. I also wanted to try and learn the basics of all my languages, so I tried to avoid using libraries for making this blog (although I did employ some jQuery).</p>
<p>Another reason was my enjoyment of blogs.They are a really neat subculture where someone can post about whatever niche they want without the stress or expectation of other social media. There isn't really the pressure of caring about likes, follows or hitting the bell icon. It's a nice relaxed place to share ideas or projects. There is also a real joy in stumbling upon a blog. You can see someones self expression, its cool to see what interested someone so much they decided to write about it. And I have even more respect for them now as what many people write and create is sent out to the digital void, and it creates a great experience to see something that at most maybe a hundred others have read. Its almost an anti-social media. It is a bit antithetical to algorithm based content and while being rough around the edges is very earnest. So as someone who really loves blogs and finding them it felt a bit wrong to not have my own.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for making this blog however is how it can help me develop my skills. Not just in creating and maintaining this blog but it's a bit of personal infrastructure that lets me keep track of my own projects. I like many others start a number of projects, but they hardly ever make it out of the "hey wouldn't this thing be neat" stage. And even if they do there is a snowball's chance in hell of actually being completed! So I wanted to make this blog as a way to hold myself more accountable, why make a blog about what projects I have done when I have none to show. It also helps me to reflect on what I have done, that way once I have made something I actually take note of how it all went and how to improve. It's also a great way to see my progress and share what I have worked on with others.</p>
<h2>Building a blog from scratch</h2>
<p>When I decided I wanted to make my own blog I had decided I wanted to build as many parts as I could. So I decided rather early on that I wouldn't be taking the easier option of building my blog on WordPress or Square space. I took this route so I could learn as much as I could while working on this project. I knew my skills in a front end as well as cloud computing (AWS) were a bit lacking. I hadn't had much chance besides my boot camp to do much front end work so I though this was the perfect opportunity. I also haven't done much dev-ops before so I thought I could get a grip on the very basics at the same time.</p>
<p>This approach to building this website has led me to develop a bit of a mantra "better done than to have none". I think this is what kept me from falling down rabbit holes of aiming for perfection and getting lost in the weeds a bit. That's why a lot of the website is awfully barren, I started it up with the intention of adding to it as needed. But since this is the first post and I am not entirely sure what the use case is going to look like beyond my intention to post projects I am not sure what needs to be added. The nice thing about it being so simple that I can just add and adjust as I go.</p>
<h2>Now that I made it, what am I going to do with it?</h2>
<p>For the next while my hope is to keep things running as is. I want to try and push a few posts related to new projects I have completed. After I have a few posts I will look into adding a search system or topic sorting system. But besides that I don't intend to make any big changes. This is a place for me to share and keep track of projects and I hope to maintain that.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Perry</p>
